# Animated-Nav-Bar
An interactive navigation menu, sleekly designed to be implemented into websites.

This was my first advanced project using CSS, and was able to complete it in roughly 2 hours.
I got the inspiration for the design from a developer on TikTok, and I tweaked their design to make it something a rookie like myself could finish in an afternoon.
